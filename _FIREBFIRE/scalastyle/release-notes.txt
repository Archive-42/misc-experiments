Version 0.3.0
=============

* Support for 2.10
* Skip PublicMethodsHaveTypeChecker for constructors
* Skip PublicMethodsHaveTypeChecker when function body does not exist
* Added ignoreOverride parameter for PublicMethodsHaveTypeChecker, if true, don't check methods with override
* For method names, ignore mutators by default (foo=_())
* Allow declaration of a customID for rules, if a rule has more than one instance (for example a regex)

* Catch usage of ??? operator

Version 0.2.0
=============

* Redundant if checker - check for if (x) then true else false
* A token regular expression checker - similar to the regular expression checker, except that it only detects tokens, so println in a comment won't match
* DeprecatedJavaChecker - check usage of @Deprecated as a java annotation
* Empty class checker - warns if an empty class is used
* underscore import checker - warns on use of wildcard imports
* Lowercase pattern matcher checker - warns on use of a lowercase pattern match case x => foo, which can cause unexpected behaviour
* duplicated string literals in a file checker.
* Import grouping checker

Also:

* Upgrade to Scala 2.9.2
* An SBT plugin, which generates checkstyle type report xml for jenkins
* Correct handling of file encoding in the maven and Eclipse plugins
* The maven plugin can optionally generate checkstyle type report xml for jenkins
* Corrections to the import checker, to cope with import selectors
