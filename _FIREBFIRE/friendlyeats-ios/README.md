# Friendly Eats

This is the source code that accompanies the
[Firestore iOS Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firestore-ios).

The codelab will walk you through developing a restaurant recommendation app
powered by Cloud Firestore on iOS.

If you don't want to do the codelab and would rather view the completed sample
code, see the [Firebase iOS Quickstart repository](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios)
or the `codelab-complete` branch.
