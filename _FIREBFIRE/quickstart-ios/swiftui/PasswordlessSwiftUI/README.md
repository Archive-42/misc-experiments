# Using Firebase Auth's Email Link Login with SwiftUI

This demo app demonstrates how to implement Firebase Auth's 
[Email Link/Passwordless Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/email-link-auth) 
in an app created with SwiftUI. At WWDC 2020, Apple announced
new lifeycle [APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app) 
that enabled developers to build apps entirely with 
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). This project uses these 
latest iOS 14 APIs in conjunction with Firebase to provide a clear 
example of how to build modern apps with Firebase and SwiftUI.

# Getting Started

Getting this project up and running is similar to the other quickstarts 
found in this repo. The following steps will clone the project, 
install its dependencies, and open the `.xcworkspace` project in Xcode.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios.git
$ cd swiftui/PasswordlessSwiftUI/
$ pod install --repo-update
$ open PasswordlessSwiftUI.xcworkspace
```
